            <p class = "paragraph">
                Nigeria's Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka
                Nwajiuba, says no date has been fixed yet for full
                schools' resumption even though the federal government
                had continued to engage stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph">This has induced mixed feelings amongst the student 
                population. While some students relish, and 
                support the decision of the minister, others abhor it.
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph">
                Whatever the feelings may be, it is not economically 
                favourable for academic institutions to remain closed.
